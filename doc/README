## PIGFARMER


This is something I started back in september 2008,
and never got around to finish it. 

Status, Jan2010
I made the initial mysql tables.
I made the perl script to pars the rulefiles, and insert them
to the mysql tables.
I made a simple webgui, but nothing works execept viewing stuff.
 - Can not manage nothing :/ yet...

Im releasing the code/project, and maybe that will make me
push myself to redo the webgui part soon. 

I have not commited the webgui. I will re-write it based on
what I learned from my fpcgui project. And push something
new for you all! Hopefully by the end of 2010!

Now that Suricata is out, which dont use SO rules (The main
thing that took away my drive from this project) I might
get eager to work some more on this :)
